# Vehicle-Detection
This repository consist of a source code  to detect cars in a video/camera frame and then draw rectangaluar boxes around them using **OpenCV** and **Haar Cascade Classifier**.
**Haar Cascade classifier** is an effective object detection approach which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “**Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features**” in 2001.
**Open Source Computer Vision Library**(OpenCV) is an open-source BSD-licensed library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.

# The Results of the system are as shown below:
